# VocalTractLabBackend-dev
This repo contains the VocalTractLab backend source code and the C/C++ API for on-going development work. *This is not the place for official stable releases!* 

You can find the bleeding edge builds here including new and experimental features, some of which may break your old projects. For official stable releases, please check [the VocalTractLab website](https://www.vocaltractlab.de).

Please feel free to fork this repo and make your own contributions, though! 

The main branch of this repo is reviewed on a semi-regular basis for inclusion into the official release.

This repo may be included in other repos as a submodule wherever the backend source code or the C/C++ API is needed.
